			<h1> Phase 0: Requirements Specification </h1>
			<p>
				The purpose of this assignment is to gain familiarity with the standard uses and syntax <br>
				of JavaScript. Since JavaScript is a slightly unconventional language there is expected <br>
				to be some problem that will be faced while completing this assignment. <br>
				Additionally, another purpose for this assignment is to gain familiarity with dynmically creating
				html elements using JavaScript. While in a standard application you will never have to 
				allocate elements at runtime, this serves as good practice <br>
				<br>
				I already know a good amount about HTML before starting this assignment, though I know next <br>
				to nothing about JavaScript. I keep being told that it can't be treated like a norma <br>
				object oriented programming language and I'm a big nervous to figure out why it is so odd. <br>
			</p>

			<h1> Phase 1: System Analysis </h1>
			<p>
				The program won't have much initial data coming in. Before runtime, the only thing that really <br>
				exists in the program is the static html file. This file does nothing else except running a <br>
				JavaScript program that will be embedded into the html. <br>
				However, there will be a good amount of user input. <br>
				The user will be able to insert two numbers, choose an operator (from a predetermined dropdown menu) <br>
				choose colors from a color element, and lastly they will be able to "click" and remove div elements <br>

			Function deleteDiv(div){
			div.remove();
					}

				Function calculate(){
					val1 = input1.textContent;
					val2 = input2.textContent;
					operator = menu.content;
					result = eval(""+val1 + operator + val2 + "");
					color = color.content;
					newDiv = document.createChild('div");

					h1 = document.createChild('h1')
					text = coument.createChild('text')
					
					h1.textContent = result
					text.textContent = val1 + operator + val2

					newDiv.appendChild(#what we just defined)

					newDiv.onclick = deleteDiv(self);


				}
				document = Document();

				header = document.createChild('div';)
				h1Tag = document.createChild('h1');
				input1 = document.createChild('input');
				input2 = document.createChild('input');
				color = document.createChild('color');
				menu = document.createChild('menu');
				button = document.createChild('button');

				#assign different attributes to the different elements 
				header.textContent = "javascript calculator")
				menu.content = #array containing different options

				#apply different elements to where they appear

				div.appendChild(menu, button, color, input1, etc.)
				document.appendChild(div)

				button.onclick = calculate();

			<h1> Phase 3: Implementation </h1>

			function calculate(){

        let color = document.getElementById('colorSelector').value
        let newDiv = document.createElement('div');
        newDiv.setAttribute('class','stuff-box')
        newDiv.setAttribute('style','background-color: '+color);
        document.body.appendChild(newDiv);



        let oldDiv = document.getElementById('mainDiv')
        let inputOneText = document.getElementById('input1').value
        let inputTwoText = document.getElementById('input2').value

                dateTime.textContent = new Date().toString();

			<h1> Phase 4: Testing & Debugging </h1>
			<p> 
			<pre>
				Luckily enough in this assignment I didn't really run into many errors.
				The most of what happened pretty much just consisted of leaving on the parenthesis
				when declaring the function for onclick listeners. I didn't realize that if you left
				the paranthesis on then it would automatically call that function regardless of whether
				you actually clicked it or not. Why that was the case, I do not know.

				But other than that I didn't really have any other bugs. I made a few syntax mistakes that I 
				since fixed, but everyting worked out okay. I feel like javascript was made out to be worse
				than it is, but idk.

			<h1> Phase 5: Deployment </h1>
			<p>
			Code pushed and submitted to gitlab
			</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h1> Maintenance </h1>
			<p>
			<pre>
				I think most all parts of my program are written pretty well (or as well as I can gauge).
				The only thing I would consider changing in the future is changing my default ".onclick" 
				attributes with an actual eventListener. But other than that I think everyting was pretty clean.

				I understand how all parts of my program work. The overall process was pretty simple I think. It 
				was just a matter of creating the html elements, connecting a few attributes to them, and then 
				formatting them on the page. Overall I think I understood it pretty well.

				If a bug is reported in a few months it would be pretty easy to find the cause, this is just
				because the program is pretty small and simple in execution. 

				My code is pretty clear and I think anyone with a programming background could understand it. 

				It would be very easy to add in a new feature, because the current working of the program are
				simple and isolated, so anything could be thrown in without disrupting the current processes. 

				The program should continue working unless JavaScript has some very sudden and strange changes, 
				or webbrowsers stop working in the same way.
